Overview
--------

The irdma Linux* driver enables RDMA functionality on RDMA-capable Intel
network devices. Devices supported by this driver:
   - Intel(R) Ethernet Controller 2100 Series (Google Cloud Only)

Intel Ethernet 2100 Series for Google Cloud supports the RoCEv2 RDMA transport.

The corresponding LAN driver (idpf) must be built from source included in
this release and installed on your system prior to installing irdma.

Note: This driver has not been tested on previous versions of Intel Ethernet hardware
and is expected to be unstable at this time. This includes X722 and E810 devices.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

- Compile and install the Intel Ethernet 2100 LAN IDPF driver from source included in
  this release. Refer to the idpf driver README for installation
  instructions.

Build
-------------

To build and install the irdma driver

1. Decompress the irdma driver archive:
        tar zxf irdma-<version>.tgz

2. Build and install the RDMA driver:
        cd irdma-<version>
        ./build.sh

3. Load the driver:
        insmod src/irdma/irdma.ko

4. Uninstall any previous versions of rdma-core user-space libraries.
   For example, in RHEL:
        yum erase rdma-core

        If yum erase doesn't work (on RHEL 8.4 it fails with "Error: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: systemd"),
        use the following command to uninstall the rdma-core packages:

        rpm -e --nodeps ibacm iwpmd libibumad libibverbs librdmacm srp_daemon infiniband-diags 2>/dev/null
        rpm -e --nodeps rdma-core

        Note: The errors in post-uninstall scritps of these packages can be ignored with 2>/dev/null.
              The packages provided to rpm -e --nodeps above could be looked up with the following command: rpm -e rdma-core
              The output is "error: Failed dependencies: rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) rdma-core-devel
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) iwpmd
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) libibumad
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) libibverbs
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) ibacm
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) librdmacm
                                                         rdma-core(x86-64) =  is needed by (installed) srp_daemon"

              To confirm that rdma-core is uninstalled after rpm -e --nodeps run: yum erase rdma-core
              The output should look like this: "No match for argument: rdma-core No packages marked for removal... Nothing to do. Complete!"

5. Obtain, patch, build, and install rdma-core user space libraries:

        # Download rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz from GitHub
        wget https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core/releases/download/v35.0/rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz
        # Apply patch provider-irdma-35.0.patch to rdma-core
        tar -xzvf rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz
        cd rdma-core-35.0
        patch -p2 < <repo_path>/provider-irdma/provider-irdma-35.0.patch
        # Make sure directories rdma-core/redhat and contents are under group 'root'
        cd ..
        chgrp -R root rdma-core-35.0/redhat
        tar -zcvf rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz rdma-core-35.0
        # Build rdma-core
        mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
        mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
        cp rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
        cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
        tar -xzvf rdma-core-35.0.tar.gz
        cp ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/rdma-core-35.0/redhat/rdma-core.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
        cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
        rpmbuild -ba rdma-core.spec
        # Install RPMs
        cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
        yum install *35.0*.rpm

--------------------------
Confirm RDMA functionality
--------------------------

After successful installation, RDMA devices are listed in the output of
"ibv_devices". For example:
    # ibv_devices
    device                 node GUID
    ------              ----------------
    rdmap175s0f0        40a6b70b6f300000
    rdmap175s0f1        40a6b70b6f310000

Notes:
    - Device names may differ depending on OS or kernel.

Each RDMA device is associated with a network interface. The sysfs filesystem
can help show how these devices are related. For example:
    - To show RDMA devices associated with the "ens801f0" network interface:
         # ls /sys/class/net/ens801f0/device/infiniband/
         rdmap175s0f0
    - To show the network interface associated with the "rdmap175s0f0" RDMA
      device:
         # ls /sys/class/infiniband/rdmap175s0f0/device/net/
         ens801f0

Before running RDMA applications, ensure that all hosts have IP addresses
assigned to the network interface associated with the RDMA device. The RDMA
device uses the IP configuration from the corresponding network interface.
There is no additional configuration required for the RDMA device.

To confirm RDMA functionality, run rping:

    1) Start the rping server:
          rping -sdvVa [server IP address]

    2) Start the rping client:
          rping -cdvVa [server IP address] -C 10

    3) rping will run for 10 iterations (-C 10) and print data payloads on
       the console.
